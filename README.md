Welcome to my Python learning journey.  
This repository documents my **daily Python practice** and **mini-projects**, built consistently to strengthen core programming fundamentals, logic-building skills, and real-world problem-solving ability.

This is a growing, hands-on codebase focused on **learning by doing**.

## ⭐ Support (Motivation Mode ON 😄)

If this repository helped you learn something—or reminded you that **everyone starts with `print("Hello, World!")`**—consider giving it a ⭐ on GitHub.

That single star:
- Boosts motivation more than coffee ☕  
- Helps maintain consistency on lazy days  
- Confirms that debugging at 2 AM was *not* pointless  

No pressure… but your ⭐ might just prevent a future infinite loop.

Code. Break it. Fix it. Repeat. 🚀
